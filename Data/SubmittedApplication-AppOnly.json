We'll also allow clubs to meet twice weekly, or daily for a 1-week school break camp., Each club should include at least 12 kids, but no more than 16 kids., Kids must be grouped Grades K-2, Grades 1-3, or Grades 3-5. Clubs can be restricted to a single grade or pair of grades within those three grade ranges, but they should not be expanded in any way.",
